# simple-starter-app
Bindings for a basic vue app (no cli) with bulma, scss, and firebase (firestore). Not suitable for production, but a good way to become familiar with the tooling.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. create a file called `config.js` with your firestore project details, using `sample-config` as a reference.
3. Download [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) and drag your project directory into it. If you use another compiler just be sure to set it up the way you like.
4. Make sure everything's working and start coding.
